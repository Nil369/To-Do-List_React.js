# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

So to begin with follow the steps:
1.Create a folder => Open terminal in that folder

2. In the terminal type the following command:
   
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
```
Type the name of your app you want to create & It will automatically generate files to get you started.My app name was todo.So it was generated in that way

3.In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:
